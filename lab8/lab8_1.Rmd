> **For Big-Data Scientists, "Janitor Work" Is Key Hurdle to Insights.**  
> "Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information."

## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Explain the difference between tidy and messy data.  
2. Evaluate a data set as tidy or messy.    
3. Use the `pivot_longer()` function of `tidyr` to transform data from wide to long format.  
4. Use `separate()` to split observations within a column.  

## Overview
The quote above sums up much of the work in data science. Simply put, most of the data that you end up working with will be messy, disorganized, and not **tidy**. By the end of this week, you will have the tools necessary to wrangle messy data into tidy data that are ready for analysis. I know that we have spent a lot of time of data transformation, but this last step is essential to building plots and performing other analyses.  

## Resources
- [tidyr `pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html)  
- [pivoting](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/pivot.html)  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Tidy data
Most "wild" data that you will encounter are organized incorrectly for work in R and, as you might expect, the tools used to transform data are a core part of the tidyverse. I will attempt to summarize the most important points below, but you should read [chapter 12 of the data science text](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) for a more thorough explanation.  

##`Tidy` data in the sense of the tidyverse follows three conventions:   
#(1) each variable has its own column  
#(2) each observation has its own row  
#(3) each value has its own cell  

This is summarized in the image below. The package used to tidy data is called **tidyr** and is a core part of the tidyverse.  
![*Tidy Data.*](tidy-1.png)

## `pivot_longer()`  
Scientists frequently use spreadsheets that are organized to make data entry efficient. This is often referred to as **wide format**. Unfortunately, the wide format creates a problem because column names may actually represent values of a variable. The command `pivot_longer()` shifts data from wide to long format.   

Rules:  
+ `pivot_longer`(cols, names_to, values_to)
+ `cols` - Columns to pivot to longer format
+ `names_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the column names of gathered columns as values
+ `values_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the data stored in the values of gathered columns

## Example 1: column names are data
The following data show results from a drug trial with four treatments on six patients. The values represent resting heart rate.  
```{r}
heartrate <- readr::read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")
heartrate
```


Want to try the `here` package?
```{r}
read_csv(here("lab8", "data", "heartrate.csv"))
```

Let's assess whether or not these data are tidy.  
(1) each variable has its own column  
*No. Some of the column names are actually variables (treatment a, b, c, or d).*  
(2) each observation has its own row  
*No. The observations are grouped in a single row by patient.*  
(3) each value has its own cell  
*Yes. There are no unusual combinations of data in each cell.*    

-Patient names, drugs, and heart rates
-But is it definition of tidydata?
-Each row has its own column
-A might be its own variable, but it has two: one is drug, the other is heart rate, so can't say every column is a variable. Column names are drugs, meaning data
-We're violating assumptions of tidydata
-First two data of tidydata aren't being met

To fix this problem, we need to reshape the table to long format while keeping track of column names and values. We do this using `pivot_longer()`. Notice that the dimensions of the data frame change.  
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(-patient, #patient does not pivot
               names_to = "drug", #Names of each column are going to be put into a new column called "drug"
               values_to = "heartrate" 
               )
```

Data will get a LOT longer this way. Ex. Margaret comes up 4 times because we're measuring her heart rate for 4 different drugs.
Heart rates all in one column, drug all in one column, patients all in one column. So fixed first 2 fundamental violations, but the data got a lot bigger, and no one in their right mind would have data layed out this way. BUT for analysis, it must be this way!

## Practice
1. Import the file `relig_income.csv` and store it as a new object `relig_income`.  
```{r}
relig_income <- readr::read_csv("data/relig_income.csv")
relig_income
```
2. Why are these data untidy?  
Religion in clean column, represents households in survey. If you look at the top, there's an issue: column names are showing you household income. Problem is that the column names themselves are data.

Data is untidy because column names represent data.

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy.  
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, #So not changing the name of religion
               names_to="income",
               values_to="count")
```

Column names actually containing data: most common kind of tidydata.

## Example 2: some column names are data
Some (but not all) of the column names are data. We also have NA's.
```{r}
billboard <- readr::read_csv("data/billboard.csv")
billboard
```

Looking at artist with track, when it was originally released, then the weeks in which it topped the charts. NAs are there, because for one song, it was off the charts.

Similar problem where column names themselves are data.

Solution 1: specify a range of columns that you want to pivot.

(Don't want to individually tag all columns, so instead, you're representing a range in the columns. No negative values there, so not holding those values in place.)
```{r}
billboard2 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(wk1:wk76, # a range of columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE #this will drop the NA's
               )
billboard2
```

Data that's tidy: still not perfect because you have that wk in there, so don't consider them as characters (which is how they're currently defined)

Solution 2: OR, specify columns that you want to stay fixed.
```{r}
billboard3 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(artist, track, date.entered), #specific columns. Keeping those values held in place, all others change
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
billboard3
```

Solution 3: identify columns by a prefix, remove the prefix and all NA's.
```{r}
billboard %>% 
   pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("wk"),
   names_to = "week", #"wk" goes to new column called week
   names_prefix = "wk", #Thing we want removed
   values_to = "rank",
   values_drop_na = TRUE)
```

-This is handy because since we identified this in wk column, we removed them

-We can also do this using the mutate command

## Practice  
1. Import `plant_data.csv` as a new object `plant_data`.  
```{r}
plant_data <- readr::read_csv("data/plant_data.csv")
plant_data
```

2. Why are these data not tidy?  
Similar to billboard problem, have day 1-30. Day is included in that, so that violates your idea of tidydata. So need to pivot this.

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy. Focus the data only on genotype, day, and measurement.  
```{r}
plant_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=starts_with("day"),
    names_to="day",
    names_prefix="day", #So don't want data to be day 1, day 2, day 3, but rather 1, 2, 3 (OH so this value removes it!)
    values_to="measurement"
  ) %>% 
  select(genotype, day, measurement)
```

Code chunks will start to get much longer, so do it in chunks and see what will run, what won't!

## Example 3: more than one variable in a column name
In this case, there are two observations in each column name.
```{r}
qpcr_untidy <- read_csv("data/qpcr_untidy.csv")
qpcr_untidy
```

Experiment 1, replicate 1, etc. Now we have 2 different variables represented in the column names. Now we need a way to pull this data apart!

`names_sep` helps pull these apart, but we still have "exp" and "rep" to deal with.  
```{r}
qpcr_untidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    exp1_rep1:exp3_rep3, # The colons change exp1_rep1 to exp3_rep3
    names_to= c("experiment", "replicate"), #Experiment will be replicate
    names_sep="_", #Column names separated by _, so tell pivot_longer we want to separate data in _
    values_to="mRNA_expression" #OOOH THIS IS SOMETHING I'M INTO WHOAAAAA THAT'S SO COOL! :D
  )
```

## Example 4: more than one value or observation in a row
This is often caused by an entry error, but R will not be able to work with it unless the values are separated. This doesn't use `pivot_longer()` but is a common problem.  
```{r}
length_data <- readr::read_csv("data/length_data.csv")
length_data
```

Sometimes there's cases where there's multiple observations for a certain sample, and sometimes you don't know what they mean. You can split it up so that B is just known by one of those values.


```{r}
length_data %>% 
  transform(length = str_split(length, ";")) %>%
  unnest(length)
```

B has been split up into 3 observations, and you don't know which is which, so sometimes might need to go back to scientist to see what that meant, but still organizes the data in a cleaner way!

## That's it! Take a break and I will see you on Zoom!
